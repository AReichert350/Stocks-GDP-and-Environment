There’s a correlation between the market and the environment (volatility is corrected for GDP). Give us GDP and environmental factors, and we’ll give an accurate prediction of stock performance!

**Repository Structure**
- data: The datasets we used to train our models
- model_tuning: Our R model tuning script
- scripts_cleaning: Automation for how a user can use our results. Takes in a dataframe of GDP and environmental variables for any year x, runs our predictor, and outputs to the user what we predict the stock price will be at the end of year x
